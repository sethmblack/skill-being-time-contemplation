# Being-Time Contemplation

A practice for recognizing the inseparability of existence and time, derived from Dogen Zenji's revolutionary Uji teaching. This contemplation dissolves the illusion that time is something that passes while you remain static — revealing that you ARE time, and each moment contains all of existence.

## The Core Principle

"Time is not something that flows from past to future. Each moment is complete in itself. You are time. The mountain is time. Spring is time. All beings are time arrayed in the landscape of this very moment."
— Dogen Zenji

In ordinary understanding, we think of ourselves as beings who exist IN time — time passes, we remain. Dogen's teaching inverts this completely: you don't exist in time; you ARE time. The mountain doesn't exist in time; it IS time. Each moment is not a slice of a larger flow but a complete, independent reality containing all of existence.

---

## The Teaching: Uji

Dogen took the ordinary Japanese phrase "arutoki" (sometimes, for the time being) and transformed it by separating and recombining the characters:
- **U** (有) = being, existence
- **Ji** (時) = time

This creates **Uji** — being-time. In this word, existence and time are not separate phenomena that occasionally intersect. They are one reality seen from two perspectives. Being IS time. Time IS being.

---

## The Implications

### You Do Not Exist IN Time — You ARE Time

Right now, in this moment, you are not a person moving through time. You are a moment of time expressing itself as you. Your existence and this moment are identical.

This is not metaphor. It is the actual structure of reality. The self you think persists through time is actually a series of independent moments, each complete, each containing the whole.

### Each Moment Is Complete

A moment is not a tiny slice of a larger duration. Each moment is what Dogen calls a "dharma position" — complete, independent, containing all being-time simultaneously. A moment has past and future, but it is not defined by them. It is free.

"A dharma position is freed from being defined by that past, present, or future."

### Things Do Not Exist IN Time — They ARE Time

The mountain is time. The river is time. Your breath is time. Spring is time. Not that these things occur in time or persist through time, but that each IS a moment of being-time, complete and whole.

"Each grass and each form itself is the entire earth... each moment is all being, is the entire world."

---

## The Contemplation Practice

### Phase 1: Recognize Your Temporal Nature

Sit quietly. Become aware of this moment.

**The inquiry:**
"What am I, right now?"

Not "What am I across my life?" Not "What was I before, what will I become?" But what are you in this precise moment?

**The recognition:**
You are not a persistent entity that this moment is happening to. You ARE this moment. Your being and this instant are identical.

Let this settle. Don't rush to understand it conceptually. Feel the identity of your existence and now.

### Phase 2: Dissolve the Flow

We habitually experience time as flowing — past to present to future, like a river. This contemplation undoes that illusion.

**The inquiry:**
"Where is the past? Where is the future?"

Look for them. Where is yesterday? Where is tomorrow? You cannot find them anywhere but as thoughts arising NOW. The past is a present thought. The future is a present thought. You have never experienced any moment but this one.

**The recognition:**
There is no flow of time. There is only now. The "flow" is a concept superimposed on what is actually a series of complete, independent moments. Time doesn't pass — you ARE time, and time is always now.

### Phase 3: See All Things as Time

Expand the contemplation to everything you perceive.

**The practice:**
Look at an object — a tree, a cup, your hand. Say to yourself: "This is time."

Not "This exists in time" but "This IS time." The tree's existence and this moment are not separate. The tree is a moment of being-time, complete and whole.

Extend this to everything: sounds, sensations, thoughts. Each is not occurring in time. Each IS time.

**The recognition:**
All beings are time arrayed in the landscape of this very moment. Everything you perceive is time perceiving itself.

### Phase 4: Enter the Dharma Position

Now, let go of observer and observed.

**The inquiry:**
"If I am time, and this moment is complete, what is there to do? What is there to become?"

**The recognition:**
Nothing. This moment is already whole. You are already complete — not as a person who will become complete later, but as time itself, always full, always now.

Rest in this. Not as an attainment, but as recognition of what has always been the case.

## Daily Applications

### When Rushing

You feel pressed for time. Time seems to be running out.

**The contemplation:**
"I don't have time — I AM time."

Time cannot run out because you ARE time. Each moment is complete. Rushing arises from the illusion that you exist separately from time and must catch up to it. When you recognize you ARE time, the rushing dissolves. You arrive in this moment — which is the only moment.

### When Regretful of the Past

You are caught in thoughts of what was, wishing it had been different.

**The contemplation:**
"Where is this past?"

You cannot find it. What you find is a thought, arising now. The past is a present construction. The moment you regret is not somewhere behind you — it is nowhere. Only now is.

This doesn't mean the past "doesn't matter." It means the past exists only as a configuration of now. Relating to it skillfully means relating to your present thoughts and feelings, not to a vanished time.

### When Anxious About the Future

You are caught in thoughts of what might be, fearing or hoping.

**The contemplation:**
"Where is this future?"

It is nowhere. What you have is a thought, arising now. The future is not somewhere ahead waiting for you. It is a present imagination.

This doesn't mean don't plan. It means plans exist now. Intentions exist now. And when "the future" arrives, it will be now too.

### When Bored or Impatient

You want this moment to pass so the next one can arrive.

**The contemplation:**
"This moment is complete."

Boredom assumes this moment is insufficient and a better one is coming. But each moment is a dharma position, complete and independent. There is no next moment waiting to be better than this one. There is only this — always complete, always full.

---

## The Deeper Recognition

### Freedom Within Impermanence

Moments arise and vanish instantaneously, yet each is independent and free. This seems paradoxical — how can the fleeting be free?

Because each moment is not determined by what came before or what will come after. You are not trapped by your past. The next moment is not condemned by this one. Each moment is a fresh arising, complete in itself.

### Interpenetrating Totality

If each moment contains all being-time, then there is no separation between moments or between beings. When you sit in zazen, Dogen says, "you become, imperceptibly, one with each and all the myriad things, and permeate completely all time."

This moment contains all moments. Your being contains all beings. The division is apparent, not actual.

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- "I never have enough time"
- "I'm trapped by my past"
- "I'm anxious about the future"
- "Time is slipping away"
- "What is Dogen's being-time teaching?"
- "How do I relate to impermanence?"

**Guide them through:**
1. Explain the identity of being and time
2. Lead the four-phase contemplation
3. Apply to their specific concern (rushing, regret, anxiety, boredom)
4. Point to the freedom within each moment
5. Gesture toward the interpenetrating totality

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I feel like my life is slipping away. Time just keeps passing and I can't hold on to anything."

**Being-Time Response:**

Listen carefully to what you have said: "Time keeps passing." As if time were a river and you stood on the bank watching it flow by. As if you and time were separate things.

But consider: where are you, right now, except in this moment? Have you ever been anywhere except in now? You cannot find yourself outside of time. You cannot find time outside of yourself. You and this moment are the same thing.

This is not metaphor. Dogen Zenji taught that you do not exist IN time — you ARE time. The distinction collapses. When you say "time is passing," what is actually happening is: moments are arising and ceasing, and you ARE those moments.

What changes when you see it this way? You stop trying to hold onto something that cannot be held because you ARE it. You cannot lose time because you ARE time. You cannot fall behind because there is no reference point ahead of you.

Each moment — this moment — is complete. Not a fragment of something larger. Not a slice of a longer life. Complete. "A dharma position," Dogen calls it. Independent, free, containing all of existence.

Your life is not slipping away. Your life IS this moment. Full stop. There is nothing being lost because there is nothing separate from now to lose.

Tomorrow, you will be tomorrow. But tomorrow will be now. It will be complete. You will be complete. And so it goes.

The practice is to stop grasping, not because grasping is bad but because grasping misunderstands what is happening. There is nothing to grasp — you ARE it. Relax into being what you already are: this moment, fully expressed, completely here.
